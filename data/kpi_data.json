Helped lift the wheel clear and they were on, we got talking and she expalined that the last time they had tried to catch the tram things hadnt gone very well  either becaue of the gap between the platform or because she nervous about getting her husband on the tram and was new at handling the wheelchair the wheels locked her husband ended up fallling on top of her and there was no one to help , the conductor felt unable to because of the no touch policy the passngers because well who knows, apparantley one young lass came and helped and cried while she was doing it because she felt so sorry for them i think that it is safe to assume  - gave her the details from lost luggage form and told her to contact Supertram about her experience and ask for reconsideration of wheelchair access or chnages to notices about ease of access of more information to help possible wheelchair users -  dont like the sound of that no touch policy i understand the need but not sure i can honestly stand by and not help in that situation ",

Conductors are not trained (or expected) to assist wheelchairs, given the level accessibility.\n\nWhilst we don't expect staff to assist, to be clear the no touch policy is not about assisting customers! I'd expect any colleague to use common sense around how that policy should be applied, specifically that it is in relation to altercations and ejection of passengers. It should never prevent a colleague from assisting a customer if the situation requires help (again, not that we'd expect them to lift a wheelchair or anything else they weren't trained to lift/move).\n\nIt's also important in such scenarios to explain how to board with a wheelchair, in that the customer should reverse on - never try to board forwards as the wheels are too small and risk getting stuck in the gap. The larger rear wheels will enable much easier and safer boarding. Similarly, when exiting wheelchairs should be reversed off for the same reasons. I will pass the comment regarding signs/guidance for wheelchair users to Rhi/Caroline.",

Additionally, the dead leg needs isolating to prevent the backfeed of bacteria.\nMDPE Supply Issue: The MDPE supply, which also feeds the Infrastructure canteen, is egressing through a partially\nopened manhole. This situation appears to have become permanent, which is in breach of the Workplace (HSW)\nregulations. These regulations mandate that all floor openings, including manholes, must be securely covered to\nprevent risks such as slips, trips, and falls, especially with said pipe sticking out.\nEnvironmental Concerns: From an environmental perspective, the open manhole/cable pit can also allow pollutants to\ncontaminate site services. To address this, I recommend removing the temporary cabin (Infrastructure canteen) also,\nwhich would eliminate these hazards.\nFurther regarding canteen facilities, the depot has two canteens (upstairs and downstairs) that can sufficiently cater\nstaff. Additionally, the East Parade canteen is available for mobile staff, with the option of staggered breaks too. The\ntotal seating capacity for information at the depot is thirty-two.\nLastly, the tyre shed defect has been tacted down as a defect under reference DV160020.\nPlease can this be added to the HSTracker also please.

      "Action/Recommendation": "Depot - Subject concerns regarding the intergrity of Supervisor logs and recommendations for improvement. Overview The current practice of maintaining supervisor logs for RSM in Microsoft Word format presents a significant\nrisk to data integrity and evidentiary reliability. As these documents are editable and lack version control or audit trails,\nthey are inherently vulnerable to post-event modification. This undermines their credibility, particularly in the event of\nan investigation by third parties such as the (RAIB) or other regulatory bodies in the event of an incident.\nRecommended Alternatives:\n1. Digital Logbook Systems with Audit Trails:\n• Implement secure, cloud-based logging platforms (e.g. RailSmart, eLogbook, or custom SharePoint solutions) that\nautomatically record all edits and user actions like the OCC log.\n• These systems provide time-stamped entries and immutable logs, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n2. PDF Archiving with or without Digital Signatures:\n• Convert completed logs to PDF format with digital signatures to lock content and verify authorship.\n• This ensures that once a log is finalized, it cannot be altered without invalidating the signature.\n3. Policy and Training:\n• Establish clear policies on logbook handling, including when and how entries should be finalized.\n• Train supervisors on the importance of data integrity and the risks associated with editable formats etc.",

This goes against procedure but is probably the most sensible course of action. However as they have gone against a bar without permission these instances are logged with CCTV, reports and SIBAS requested. This is creating work for OCC, DMs and SHEQ for investigations. It's also leaving a mark against the driver in their file and creating extra work for training. When drivers report this most of them say they've done this to not stop on a busy road and/or have cars under or overtake the tram, or so that pedestrians don't walk out thinking the tram has stopped for a red light with cars still passing. As a professional driver they have made a decision that is procedurally wrong but is the most common sense approach to a problem. The driver has worked through with caution on a green light as OCC would have instructed and then informed OCC. The driver hasn't tried to hide the fact they've gone through a green and bar but the driver faces investigation for reporting it to us. This could cause drivers to stop reporting these instances which is a far worse situation.\n",

This was extremely unsafe as the road narrowed before the tram had finished overtaking me, so the space foe me and my bike to fit in became very tight. I knocked on the window to ensure the driver was aware of what had happened and he immediately gesticulated angrily at me. It felt like he had been annoyed that I was cycling, and had knowingly squeezed past in an unsafe manner, and still felt that the situation was in some way my fault just because I was cycling. It was scary and unsafe, and I was angry that the driver didn't seem to understand this or take responsibility.",

For whatever reason, the tram doors closed before grandma could board and this left the little girl unaccompanied on the vehicle. She approached a conductor who we can  only identify at this time as an older man, to inform him of her situation.  The conductors response was \"You will have to wait until the next stop to get off because the tram can't stop\". At this point a passenger intervened - this was a female - and she said \"You will be alright, I will wait for you until your Nanna comes on the next tram\" This lady was prepared to complete the journey to Middlewood and wait with the child. In the meantime, Grandma has rung the caller (Mum) and informed her of the situation. Mum and Dad went to Middle wood tram stop and met their daughter at this point.It was only afterwards and in speaking with both her daughter and the passenger that the situation became apparent.EV/2024/04145",
